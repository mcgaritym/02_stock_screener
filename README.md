The purpose of this project is to evaluate stock prices and employ various machine learning methods to try and predict their behavior in the future. The motivation for this project is due to personal interest (investing), and the fact that stocks provide a wealth of historical data to include in a machine learning problem. Also, I am interested in determining the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on stocks in general. 

The data sources for this project include scraped news headlines from a variety of top financial news sources (for financial news sentiment), the yahoo finance API (for financial fundamentals such as stock prices, earnings, P/E ratios), and the NASDAQ website (for stock tickers, sectors, and industries). 

This project will try and answer these questions:

- Which stocks have the greatest rate of return before vs. during COVID-19?
- Which sectors have the greatest rate of return before vs. during COVID-19?
- Which industries have the greatest rate of return before vs. during COVID-19?
- How have sector stock prices changed over time during COVID-19?
- Can stock price changes be used to cluster groups of individual stocks?
- Which financial news sources have the highest/lowest headline sentiment? 
- Which stocks are correlated to financial news sentiment?
- Which sectors/industries are correlated to financial news sentiment?
- Can we screen stocks that are good value based on average sector Price/Earnings ratio, and quarterly growth percent?
